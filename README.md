## Overview

### The challenge

As part of the hiring process, the goal was to showcase proficiency in building a responsive To-Do list application with specific requirements:

- Users can add a new item to the existing list
- Users can edit an item from the existing list
- Users can mark the item as complete or mark the item as incomplete
- Users can delete the item from the existing list
- Users have access to their to-do items on any device. For data persistence use [Mockapi](https://mockapi.io/)

- The application has to be optimized for mobile devices
- The application uses React and optionally Next.js as a server
- Nice to have requirements (optional):
  - Users can manage multiple lists in the to-do application
  - Users can specify advanced properties for each todo item
  - Priority
  - Due date
  - Tags
  - Dark mode
